# ðŸ“º My Media Review Tracker

**A personal project inspired by Derek Sivers' book tracking website**

Ever finish watching an amazing movie or TV show, only to completely forget what you thought about it a few months later? That's exactly what happened to me, and that's why I built this web app for my bootcamp capstone project.

I was inspired by myanimelist.net which had a webpage for anime reviews but I got the idea to add TV series and movies to the idea.

## What I Built 

This is my capstone project for my web development bootcamp, and honestly, I'm pretty proud of how it turned out! Here's what it does:

### The Cool Stuff âœ¨
- **Smart Search**: Instead of manually typing everything, you can search across multiple databases (TMDB for movies/TV, MyAnimeList for anime, and TVMaze for more TV shows). The app automatically fills in posters, release dates, genres - all that good stuff.
- **Personal Reviews**: Rate everything 1-10 and write your thoughts. I added a separate notes section too for those random thoughts you want to remember.
- **Sorting & Filtering**: Want to see your highest-rated anime? Or just movies from this year? The filtering system makes it super easy to find what you're looking for.
- **Actually Looks Good**: I spent way too much time on the CSS, but it was worth it. Responsive design, smooth animations, even keyboard shortcuts (press 1-4 to filter by type!).

### What I Learned Along the Way ðŸŽ“
This project taught me a ton about:
- Working with multiple APIs and handling their different response formats
- PostgreSQL database design (learned about indexes the hard way!)

## Getting It Running

### What You'll Need
- Node.js (I used v18 but v14+ should work)
- PostgreSQL (I had some experience in college so it was not hard)
- A TMDB API key (free but required - the other APIs don't need keys!)

### Setup Steps
```bash
# Clone my project
git clone https://github.com/anthonyjomarq/Movie-review---Capstone-5.git
cd media-review-tracker

# Install all the things
npm install
```

Create a `.env` file (this hides your key from other people and your personal stuff):
```env
# Database stuff
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_PORT=5432
DB_NAME=media_tracker
DB_USER=your_username
DB_PASSWORD=your_password

# The only API key you actually need
TMDB_API_KEY=get_this_from_tmdb

# Server config
PORT=3000
```

Set up the database:
I did this manually i just created the database and use the query.sql in the project

# Run my setup script
npm run setup-db
```

Start it up:
```bash
# Development mode (auto-restarts when you make changes)
npm run dev

# Or just run it normally
npm start
```

Then go to `http://localhost:3000` and start tracking your media!

## How I Built This

### The APIs I'm Using
- **TMDB**: The big one for movies and TV shows. Great data, good images, free tier is generous.
- **Jikan (MyAnimeList)**: Perfect for anime. No API key needed which is nice.
- **TVMaze**: Extra TV show coverage. Also free, also no key needed.

The tricky part was making them all work together and ranking the search results intelligently. I probably overthought the relevance scoring algorithm, but it works pretty well!

### Database Design
I kept it simple with one main table for reviews and a view for statistics:

```sql
-- The main table where everything lives
CREATE TABLE media_reviews (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    title VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    media_type VARCHAR(50) CHECK (media_type IN ('movie', 'tv', 'anime')),
    tmdb_id INTEGER UNIQUE,
    poster_url TEXT,
    rating INTEGER CHECK (rating >= 1 AND rating <= 10),
    review_text TEXT NOT NULL,
    notes TEXT,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    -- ... and some other fields
);
```

Nothing too fancy, but it gets the job done!

## The Learning Journey

### Things That Went Well
- The multi-API search actually works better than I expected
- The UI turned out pretty clean (I'm not a designer but I tried!)
- PostgreSQL wasn't as scary as I thought it would be
- Got really comfortable with async/await and Promises

### Things That Were Challenging
- Handling different API response formats and merging them intelligently
- Making the search results relevant (turned into a mini algorithm problem)

### If I Did It Again
- Would probably add user authentication from the start
- Maybe use a CSS framework instead of writing everything from scratch
- Set up better error logging earlier in the process
- Write more modular code (some of my functions got pretty long)
